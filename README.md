# Save Ukraine Now 🇺🇺🇦❤️‍🔥

On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a military attack on Ukraine. Civilians are dying each day due to Russia's acts of aggression against Ukraine.

For those who want to help Ukrainians, I prepared a list of trusted charity organizations that need help. 

I personally support them and follow their activity. Please give this project a star if you find it helpful.

Currently this landing page works correctly only on the desktop.  Mobile version is under the way. 

Glory To Ukraine!

P.S. Thanks To **The Odin Project** For Guidance 🙏
